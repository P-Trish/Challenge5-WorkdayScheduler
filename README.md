    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

I'd like to credit my friends Ryan and Zack who are currently web developers in San Diego, CA and Los Angeles, CA.  They each were able to help me walk through the step-by-step of coming up with my code as well as testing to make sure it ran correctly.
